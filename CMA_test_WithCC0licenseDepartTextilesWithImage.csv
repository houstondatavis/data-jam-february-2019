Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images."

Six tearful, elaborately draped figures are shown mourning over the body of Christ.

The technique was introduced in Italy by Flemish and French weavers during the 1400s. Christ’s stiffened body is arranged in the shape of the cross. His shoulder rests on the Virgin’s knees, Saint John cradles his left arm, and Mary Magdalen supports his feet. Joseph of Arimathea carries the three nails with which Christ was crucified."

Éléonore is pregnant, revealed by her upturned skirt and the persimmon in her husband Hector’s hand. Hector’s mother, Marguerite, in dark attire, will wed the widowed Sala in 1519. They appear in front of the royal chateau of Blois. The figures at the right convey Sala’s advice to his children. Time (the old man with the staff) with Clio, the Muse of History, standing on his shoulders, is being attacked by a Herculean youth wielding a stick. With this allegory, Sala is explaining that youth is ignorant of the complexities of life and time. The small unicorn at the far right represents the soul. The verse in Old French at the top refers to changing time: <em>One sees Time adorned with green foliage, Sometimes as pleasant as an angel, Then suddenly change and become quite strange.

Initially, it was closely associated with silk patterns that were woven in the well established textile industry in Islamic Spain. Here, the Islamic influence is apparent in the paired eagles and gazelles flanking concentric bulb-shaped palmettes. Many variations of this design were woven in Italy during the 1300s. Examples that belonged to a pope, cardinal, and bishop provide dates between 1334 and 1361 based on their obituaries. Inventories in the Vatican also describe vestments displaying animals and birds with gold heads throughout the1300s. Here, costly gold thread was only interlaced where it is visible in the pattern."

Even with faded colors, this grand length retains ten colors of velvet pile, a feat that Iranian velvet weavers achieved by skillfully replacing colored pile warp during weaving, and thereby creating the most colorful velvets in the world. Elegant youths dominate the simplified outdoor setting here with diminutive cypresses and silver ponds on a ground originally covered with gold thread. Fashionably dressed young men wear wide-brimmed hats, silver robes, stole-like scarves, and knotted sashes that are symbols of status and rank."

The figures in this landscape are about the same size and equally spaced with minimal interaction, yet they create movement that disguises the repeat of the design. Although the history of textiles is replete with anonymity, signed silks were woven in Iran around 1600. The name of the presumed designer, Abdallah, appears in cursive script on the tambourines. The rise of signed textiles followed a shift away from royal manuscript patronage, causing artists to sign their work to sell in the marketplace. European influence, a new distinguishing hallmark, was transmitted through engravings by traveling European artists."

During the 11th and 12th centuries, Spanish weavers not only drew freely upon Byzantine and Near Eastern models for their designs, but at times went so far as to create outright forgeries.

At the far left, a figure touches a human head with its tongue, and severed heads tip the streamers that flow from several other figures. In Nasca art, severed heads seem to symbolize the life force used to promote nature's fertility. Procession, apparently a part of Nasca ceremonial life, perhaps had the same goal. For instance, we suspect that the Nasca lines—huge ground drawings of lines, geometric forms, and animals—were walked by processions during water rites, because the lines are like paths and often relate to nearby rivers. Several of the figures wear feline mouth masks. One figure wears outspread wings, others a tunic (shirt) and either a triangular loincloth or a skirt, all items of male costume.

He is particularly noted for having reinvented the genre of the pastoral, creating images of shepherds and shepherdesses as sentimental lovers that was taken up in a variety of medium. Boucher's sketchy manner of painting helped to promote painterliness as an end in itself. This trend dominated French painting until the emergence of Neoclassicism, when the tides of criticism turned against Boucher and his followers."", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1703', 'death_year': '1770'}]",Bequest of John L.

Originating during the 1300s from simple folk plays, Noh drama evolved into formal presentations of ritual, theater, dance, and music performed in the courts and shrines of the nobility. Stories were derived from a variety of sources—myths, legends, poetry, and prose—many dating back to the medieval period. Because great importance was placed on subtlety and elegance, plots tended to be minimal. Whether male or female all roles were played by men. Central to these performances were the masks and costumes worn by the actors. The brilliance and elegance of this robe are characteristic of costumes made solely for Noh theater. Its date in the first half of the 1700s is indicated by the proportions of the robe, the choice of embroidery stitches (satin, couching, and outline), and the absence of decoration at the hips, a fashion also reflected in kimonos at that time. The design of weeping cherry trees and irises in the snow was very likely inspired by a medieval Japanese poem. Robes decorated with embroidery against a gold ground were reserved for female roles. These robes were worn under the external garment and were only partially visible."

Vighnantaka is an emanation of the Buddha Akshobhya, who is blue in color and is invoked to aid in quelling anger.

The tradition of brocade weaving in northern China continued after the
Mongol conquest. However, the arrival of eastern Iranian craftsmen affected
both the design and the structure of the brocades: patterns became
symmetrical and paired warps replaced single warps. Both of these
modifications can be observed in this example. At the same time, however,
the Jin tradition of floating foundation wefts across the back sides of the
brocaded areas continued. Brocades such as this may have been woven in
Hongzhou (in Hebei province), where weavers from both Western Asia and from
the former Jin capital, Bianjing, are known to have worked together."

The cloths are joined down the center with an opening left for the head and at the sides with arm holes left open at the shoulders. This means that the looms on which the cloths were woven were very wide (averaging about 80 inches), and that the warps were relatively short (only about 20 inches long). This unususal structure does not occur prior to the Huari-Tiahuanaco culture, but strongly influenced the construction of later Inca tunics. The formal designs of Huari-Tiahuanaco-style tunics consist of vertical columns, each ornamented with a repetition of one or two very abstract motifs, in this case a human head and an animal (bull?) head. Plain bands, such as the dark red bands seen here, vary in their length and width from one tunic to another. Very likely, such tunics were worn only by privileged persons, and their designs were determined by the rank and position of their owners."

This is one of the very few northern Chinese silk and gold textiles to have
survived from the Yuan dynasty. The curled dragons chasing pearls, the
phoenixes, and the background of tiny hexagons are Chinese motifs, but the
lobed roundels enclosing the dragons and phoenixes indicate the influence
of eastern Iranian craftsmen who had been relocated to northern China.

A red and gold silk woven with the same pattern is preserved in Beijing.
The extraordinary survival of the two silks demonstrates that patterns were
typically used over and over."

As one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of his day, Morris filtered his love of nature through the lens of history. Later textiles with strong diagonal orientation, such as <em>Kennet,</em> show a debt to the centuries-old Italian cut velvet that he had studied. Named after a river in the south of England that flows into the Thames, <em>Kennet</em> is an example of one of his patterns that could be purchased in a variety of colors and fabrics, including cotton, velveteen, silk, and Madras muslin, creating limitless possibilities to appeal to consumers’ needs and tastes."

It was stitched by nuns in the Premonstratensian Convent in Altenberg on the Lahn, near Trier, and was used to cover the church’s high altar in the weeks leading up to Easter. The cloth is an example of linen embroidery, a specialty of German nuns in the later Middle Ages. Since both the ground and pattern are white, a technique known as “white-on-white,” the effect of this type of embroidery depends on the variety and skilled manipulation of the stitches used. The nuns at Altenberg may have had an additional reason for creating this white-on-white embroidery: they were known as “white canons” because of the color of their habits. The Premonstratensians followed the Rule of Saint Augustine, but with supplementary statutes that made their life one of great austerity. The sustaining focus of their community was common prayer and celebration of the Eucharist. The overall design of this altar cloth, befitting its function, concerns the redemption of the world through the death and resurrection of Christ. Figures are displayed within quatrefoils, or four-lobed, frames. The largest quatrefoil, in the center, represents Christ’s crucifixion flanked by the Virgin and Saint John. It bears the inscription ""Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world, have mercy on us."""

Bands of pearls and split palmettes and the deer with mushroom-shaped antlers originated in Iran and Sogdiana but migrated to China during the Tang dynasty (618-907). Although these motifs disappeared from Chinese art after the fall of the Tang, they survived in Central Asia for centuries. The dragon is Chinese in origin, but has a Central Asian form (particularly its extended snout). Also characteristic of Central Asia are the placement of the dragon among flowers, the liveliness of the animals, the use of floral sprays of varying scale and species, and the brilliant colors. The combination of unrelated patterns (bands of tigers chasing deer next to the dragon among flowers) probably evolved from the ancient practice of applying borders to garments with contrasting designs."

The motif of the hare among bushes may relate to the hunting activities of
the Khitan, the Jurchen, and the Mongols. Hare hunts are recorded in the
Liaoshi (History of the Liao Dynasty) and were often reported by envoys
returning to China from the northern states.

The asymmetry of the image in this textile is characteristic of Jin
brocades. However, the paired (instead of single) warps reveal the
influence of craftsmen from the eastern Iranian world and therefore dates
the textile to the Mongol period."

The mysterious image of a deerlike animal gazing up at the moon among
clouds has been variously interpreted over many centuries. The animal,
lying down with one foreleg extended and looking back, originated as a
djeiran, or Central Asian antelope. Commonly appearing on Sogdian silver
from the 600s onward, the motif migrated via the trade routes to northern
China. There, during the Jin and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties, it was very
popular and always depicted with the moon supported by clouds. Chinese
writers often identify the djeiran as the mythical rhinoceros (xi'niu) that
is said to gaze at the moon, or as the cow of Wu ""panting upon seeing the
moon."""

A doctor attributed his cause of death at age 62 to “simply being William Morris, and having done more work than most ten men.” His decorative arts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., known simply as Morris &amp; Co. after 1875, designed and sold household furnishings that were sought after for their elegant, colorful patterns and high-quality materials. Morris insisted on producing goods under fair labor conditions, which set him apart from many Victorian manufacturers for whom industrialism meant imposing grueling hours for low wages in dangerous factories. During an age when rooms were stuffed with mass-produced objects and teeming with ornament, Morris challenged consumers to embrace harmony and restraint in decoration: “Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.” Textiles were among the most profitable of the company’s merchandise and included embroidery, printed cotton, woven fabrics, tapestries, and carpets. Morris’s designs and working philosophy combined a vast knowledge of the past with a vision for the future. His final labor of love, the Kelmscott Press, was founded in 1890 and produced beautiful books with ornaments and typefaces that Morris designed. They were often illustrated by his friend Edward Burne-Jones and other artists. Morris wanted readers to enjoy the tactile experience of holding and reading from these volumes. Printed on high-quality linen paper, many are bound in vellum (animal skin). Their designs have much in common with books printed in the earliest years of the printing press."

The dry environment of the Paracas Peninsula has preserved many of these goods, including the richly ornamented garments buried with important individuals. This mantle, probably worn like a cloak, was part of a set of matching garments that also includes a shirt and a long headband. To create this garment, three strips of blue cloth were stitched together side by side. The double-bird motifs of both the field and the borders were embroidered in vivid red, blue, yellow and green yarns. The linear form of the embroidery and the nesting of the motifs are typical of what is called the Paracas Cavernas Style.

The angular, geometric designs of the warp ikat can be traced back to the bronze age culture of China.  During the first millennium B.C., elements of that culture spread to Indonesia where they survived in remote areas well into the 20th century.

Completely different are the mysterious, curvilinear forms of the embroidered bands.  Some of these have become too abstracted to identitfy; but others can be recognized as human figures wearing the feathered and horned headdresses of head-hunting rituals.  Embroidery designs were presented by a man to his prospective bride, and their motifs were inspired by activities specifically performed by men, such as wood carving, metalwork, and headhunting."

Two themes have been combined in this embroidery. The tree peony and rocks
resemble Chinese paintings of plants growing among rocks that were
associated with gardens. Here, however, the rocks emerge directly from the
sea, resembling the Taoist Islands of the Immortals in the Eastern Ocean.
In the background are Buddhist and Taoist symbols.

Judging from the bracketed border in the lower portion, the embroidery
preserves most of one lobe of a cloud-collar medallion. Each of the three
other lobes would have been embroidered with the same design.

Although fragmentary, this textile is an outstanding example of needleloop
embroidery. Especially fine is the intricacy of the diaper patterns of tiny
holes through which the silvered paper beneath sparkles."

He strongly preferred experimenting with natural dyes instead of using the garish chemical ones that had become standard in industrialized England. Even though organic dyes were expensive and scarce, and required dyers to revive old methods, they were less likely to fade in the light or during washing, and they were capable of producing more subtle tonal effects. A sense of the process of hand-weaving can be understood by looking at the back of this textile. The warp (up and down) threads are light blue and green—visible at the bottom. The textile was woven in long lengths that could be cut at these passages of loose thread. The weft (side to side) threads in several colors, including red, pink, yellow, and blue, are more visible from the back than the front, where they disappear into the pattern."

With the spread of Buddhism, the motif migrated into the art of Central Asia and, from there, into the art of northern China. In Italy, exotic Central Asian patterns such as this inspired flights of imagination.

This example has two old Navajo designs: the terraced diamond and the striped moki pattern. Moki’s origin is unclear. It may have come from Pueblo peoples, from whom the Navajo learned weaving after migrating to the Southwest from Canada. Or it could have come from the Spaniards, who arrived in the Southwest in 1540, not long after the Navajo. Though the patterns are old, the blanket was created around 1900 when Navajo weavers began to innovate for the Anglo market, and wearing-blankets, which were worn around the shoulders, became rugs sold to outsiders. In Navajo legend, weaving is connected to the mythic Spider-Woman, who on her loom wove the universe from cosmic materials. Weaving, then, is an activity charged with meaning. The Navajo place emphasis not so much on the final product but on the process, which they regard as a means of creating beauty and projecting it onto the world."

Its finely detailed motifs, some with eccentric drawing, are woven in tapestry weave-the equivalent of painting with weft thread; discontinuous horizontal wefts are interlaced only where needed in the design.

This needleloop embroidery is distinguished by its exceptionally fine
execution. Few other examples incorporate the variety of intricate diaper
patterns seen here.

Like most needleloop embroideries, the phoenix is fragmentary. Rows of
loops worked over pieces of gilded or silvered paper make needleloop
embroidery quite heavy. On the other hand, the ground fabrics upon which
they were executed were usually light-weight silks. Unable to support the
embroidery, they simply wore out over time."

Pendants were used extensively in Buddhist settings where they were
attached to almost anything needing decoration: ritual objects, canopies,
valances, pillars and other architectural components. They could be made in
a variety of ways. This example consists of a heading and six tiers, each
embroidered separately and then attached, one to the next. The earliest
known pendant of this type was found in Central Asia and dates from the
Tang dynasty (ad 618-907). The 14th-century date of this pendant is
indicated by the style of the flowers.

These engaging little birds are embroidered in a naturalistic style that
developed during the 8th and 9th centuries. All but one are oriented away
from the central pair that flanks a tulip growing from a hill. Contrasting
with the spontaneity of the birds is the structured pattern of the silk
ground-rosettes within a lozenge grid. Such contrasts frequently occur
among embroideries of the Tang dynasty. Also characteristic of embroideries
from that period is the use of discrete areas of color with no attempts at
shading.

The form of the birds, the hill, and the flower are based on Persian
models. The introduction of foreign motifs into the decorative arts of
Central Asia and China was one of the most important results of active
trading in precious objects along the Silk Road.

The robe is embroidered on the back with clouds and paired phoenixes
(associated with female members of the imperial family). Single phoenixes
and clouds occur at the shoulders. On the front, fragments of another large
pair of phoenixes remain. The birds and clouds are set against a scrolling
vine pattern embroidered with gold thread, of which only the gold leaf
remains.

The design was drawn and then embroidered with silk and gold threads on
lengths of fabric (gauze backed with silk) before they were cut and seamed.
The robe was then lined, with silk batting between the layers for warmth.

Toward the end of the Liao dynasty, rules for wearing Khitan-style dress
(overlapping toward the left) became increasingly relaxed. This may explain
the robe's front overlap toward the right, which accords with Chinese
custom.

A description of the reconstruction of this robe can be found in the

In the ikat technique, the design was dyed on the warp before it was woven in a resist-dye process. Thread was tightly wrapped around the warp to resist dye penetration for each area of color.

Rulers owned thousands of tents. They were used for shelter, shade, and innumerable functions in tent compounds that were essential for imperial ceremonies, travel, and military campaigns. Distinguished by size with elaborately decorated interior walls and ceilings, tents could be as large as castles. Opulent tents were also presented as imperial gifts. 
Tents are only known through documents before 1600. For example, in Baghdad in 809, Caliph Harun al-Rashid owned 4,000 ceremonial tents and 150,000 camping tents that were stored in the imperial Abbasid treasury. An astonishing variety and quantity of tents were housed in the royal Fatimid tent storeroom in Cairo in 1068-69, including ""military tents, fortress tents, and castle tents, manufactured of . . . gold-brocaded stuff embroidered with designs of elephants, wild beasts, horses, peacocks, birds."" 
Since 1600, Ottoman Turkish tents with elaborate floral decoration have been preserved in Istanbul in the Topkapi Palace Museum and Military Museum, and in European collections as war booty, primarily from the Ottoman Turks' attempt to conquer Vienna in 1683. 
In contrast, royal tents from Iran are extremely rare. This spectacular ceremonial tent is embroidered with the name of its owner, Muhammad Shah, who ruled Iran from 1834 to 1848 during the Qajar dynasty. The radiant jewel-like interior features exuberant flora, blossoming vines, and robust birds made with colored wool embellished with silk-thread embroidery. "

This cloth was made for export to Thailand where lattice designs were preferred.

Here, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller depicts Countess Zichy (later Széchenyi) in the latest Viennese fashion, wearing an elegant evening
gown and prestigious Kashmir shawl. Her rich jewelry features a Swiss gold bracelet set with gems and Geneva figured enamels. The elegant portrayal against a mountainous landscape typifies the Biedermeier style of painting in Vienna between 1815 and 1865. 

Thousands of luxurious shawls imported from Kashmir, India, were status symbols that European-manufactured imitations could not equal. Those woven in Paisley, Scotland, gave rise to the popular term paisley. Such floral paisley motifs decorate the ends of the blue Kashmir shawl lavishly draped around the Countess, resembling the example exhibited here. Their representation in portraits records the evolution of shawl fashions, which helps to date surviving examples.

The coveted quality of Kashmir shawls was achieved with luxurious fine goat hair woven in twill tapestry to form small colorful blossoms. Such shawls are lightweight, supple, and warm. A plethora of blossoms arranged in small vases on stands form the large paisley or boteh motifs, while smaller versions enliven the sides of the field. Such floral displays evolved from blossoming plants possibly in 16th-century India.

It was one of the many themes that developed in the visual arts as a result of the controversy over the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin and the development of the cult of Saint Anne. Lending authority to the immaculist theme in the embroidery are symbols of the evangelists and, and in the corners, Saints Jerome, Gregory the Great, Augustine, and Anselm—the four fathers of the Latin Church. Linen embroidery was a cottage industry in South Germany and the German cantons of Switzerland where the Gothic tradition persisted well into the 1600s. As is characteristic of linen embroidery, only the design of this panel is embroidered, using 18 different stitches. The monumentality of the design, the dignity and spontaneity of the figures, and the fine execution of the embroidery itself distinguish this as one of the finest examples of Swiss or South German linen embroidery of the 1500s."

These colorful designs would have decorated the front or back of a tunic and one sleeve.

Elaborate embellishments were cherished. Thus, once a tunic began to fray, its decoration was sewn onto a new one, as seen on this winterweight woolen tunic cloth.

Together with several similar designs, they alternated with areas of undyed linen decorated with scattered wool and linen tapestry-woven motifs. Although decorative motifs were often woven into the ground fabric, this panel was sewn on afterwards. During the late Roman and early Christian period curtains with woven or applied decoration were used in churches and Christian meeting rooms to separate the clergy from the congregation. They were also hung in doorways and between columns both inside and outside. Their importance is evident in numerous portraits of religious figures and laymen represented between curtained arches.

In Navajo thought, illness is caused by an imbalance in natural forces, which healing rites try to correct. To that end the drypaintings, created by pouring crushed pigments onto a sand-covered floor, often diagram an ordered, harmonious universe.

Here four spiritual beings, perhaps patrons of the plants that sprout between them, radiate from a circular pool of water. By body color and position, these beings describe phases of the sun's motion, placing them in balanced relation-the white of eastern dawn light appears across from yellow (the western sunset), and the black night sky (north) balances midday's blue (south). Encircling the group is a rainbow, which carries spiritual beings between this world and ""the other side.""

Drypainting rites are performed during the last half of complex, eight-day healing ceremonies. After each painting is completed, its figures are brought to life with a blessing. Then the patient-called the ""one-sung-over"" because a singer (hataalii) chants much of the ceremony-sits on the painting and its pigments are applied to the ailing body. In this way, the one-sung-over is identified with the painting.

All are made of white cotton miraculously hand-spun into gossamer yarns only 0.1 to 0.2 millimeters in diameter. And all reveal a great love of differing textures, some heavy and sculptural and others as ethereal as a sigh. This textile was probably used as a turban. The folded, plain, central section would have been wrapped around the head and tied in place, with the decorated panels hanging down the back or to the side. The turban and the other textiles of the set were most likely used by a high-ranking lord of the Chimú empire, which, after about 1200, controlled much of Peru’s desert north coast."

A lady was required by Turkish etiquette to use a napkin “daintily over the tips of her fingers,” lest she lose her social standing. Towels were not only essential components of everyday life but also gifts, prizes, and decorations.

Embroideries could also depict images of daily life. Colorful tents and buildings in floral landscapes, here enriched with shiny gilt-metal strips, adorn the four sides of a head scarf that was worn either folded or unfolded and fastened beneath the chin. Square embroideries also served to wrap gifts, letters, and objects; the 19th-century English traveler Charles White commented that “no present is made . . . unless folded in a handkerchief, embroidered cloth, or piece of gauze. The more rich the envelope, the higher the compliment to the receiver.”"

Floral and foliate motifs generally dominate, emboldened with several shades of red and multiple borders, perhaps conveying cosmological, medicinal, or fertility associations. However, few display a more bountiful blossoming garden than seen here. Flora radiates from the central fan-like bouquet, a design echoed in the corners of the field and in the wide border, which is characteristic of work from Bukhara, Uzbekistan. Patterns were drawn on several loosely joined cotton cloths and then embroidered in chain stitch."

Shiny gilt- and silver-metal thread and at least ten colors of silk thread—including newly fashionable pastel tones—create three-dimensional blossoms in the central roundel and multicolored cornucopias on the lavender silk ground. In Turkey, square cloths embroidered with one or two concentric circles in the center of floral fields were generally used to cover stored turbans, a function well served by this elegant cover with weighted golden borders."

This rare silk fabric with painted figural and foliate decoration may have been a luxurious wall covering in a palace or grand mansion in the city of Kashan where mural paintings display similar 19th-century designs. Glistening silver pigment originally formed the palmette-leaf compartment outlines (now mostly deep yellow) that display colorful blossoming plants enlivened with now tarnished silver peacocks. At their junctures, portrait medallions of Iranian princesses are distinctly Qajar in attire and style, as are the composite blossoming plants."

This batik was produced in the central regions of Java where cloths were resist-dyed with traditional designs in white, indigo blue, and dark brown.  The stylized wing and tail of the mythical bird Garuda and the sacred mountains seen here had cosmic significance and were reserved for textiles worn by nobility for ceremonial occasions or for dance costumes.

However, due to the influence of Islam, they are represented in a very abstract, stylized fashion.  In this batik, a celestial scene--probably signifying the ritual renewal of community life and prosperity--is repeated against a background of small filling motifs.  The scene consists of a ship (represented as a divided bow and stern) bearing a Tree of Life, which signifies the community's passage to renewed life; on either side of the ship is a winged pavilion; and above is a sacred mountain, the abode of the gods, with a shrine."

While his earliest lessons were given by his father, Vernet also worked in the studio of François-André Vincent (1746-1814) until 1810. The following year Vernet created caricatures for the Journal des dames et des modes, an activity he would continue until 1815. He was first accepted at the Salon in 1812, and his talent so impressed Jérôme Bonaparte that he commissioned an equestrian portrait from Vernet. Throughout his life, he would receive many official commissions for contemporary history paintings. Vernet kept a busy studio that, during the first years of the Restoration, was used as a meeting place for liberals. When some of his paintings were rejected from the 1822 Salon because of their supposed antiroyalist subject matter, Vernet displayed them at his studio, attracting large crowds. Despite the Salon rejection, Vernet was elected to the Institut de France in 1826 and became the director of the Académie de France in Rome two years later, a position he would occupy until 1835. After his return to Paris, Vernet became a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts."", 'name_in_original_language': None, 'birth_year': '1789', 'death_year': '1863'}]","The A. W.

It has exceptionally rich crimson silk pile, almost twice as dense as later monochrome velvets.

The brocaded pattern of three balls and paired wavy bands is known as chintamani, derived from the Sanskrit word for a popular Buddhist motif, “the three jewels,” which in Buddhist art across Asia is shown surrounded by flames or foliage. Based on the high frequency of its use in art for the Islamic court of the Ottoman Turks, it appears to have been a favored motif and possibly even an unofficial imperial emblem."

They belong to a sizeable group of comparable silk decorations found in Akhmim, Egypt. In each roundel, a stylized palmette tree is enclosed within a simplified lotus border which evolved from an ancient Egyptian lotus motif.

These delicate silks were woven on large looms with automatic pattern repetition, called drawlooms. Dark blue and ivory silk horizontal wefts dominate, interlaced by vertical warps in a diagonal twill weave. A second inner warp does not come to the surface; one inner warp is visible between each interlacing warp. This compound weave, with two warps, is often called complementary weft twill with inner warps (samit)."

In each roundel, a stylized palmette tree is enclosed within a simplified lotus border which evolved from an ancient Egyptian lotus motif.

These delicate silks were woven on large looms with automatic pattern repetition, called drawlooms. Dark blue and ivory silk horizontal wefts dominate, interlaced by vertical warps in a diagonal twill weave. A second inner warp does not come to the surface; one inner warp is visible between each interlacing warp. This compound weave, with two warps, is often called complementary weft twill with inner warps (samit)."

His hair stands on end, and his eyes-including his third eye of wisdom-bulge with ferocity. These attributes, plus the powerful bulk of his body, convey his ability to eradicate obstacles to enlightenment. Though unsigned, the painting appears to have been made by a high-ranking Tibetan patriarch. 

Rare examples of textiles from the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368), the upper and lower borders feature
the Indian man-eagle Garuda, who in Tibetan Buddhism is associated with Vajrapani. Garuda hovers over the three Islands of the Immortals that rise from the stylized waters of the Eastern Sea, a motif associated with the Chinese religion of Daoism. Cross-cultural visual references to Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese images come together in this remarkable devotional ensemble."

Luxury textiles with elaborate patterns were woven on large looms called drawlooms that automatically repeated designs. The weaver operated the structure, inserting horizontal wefts, while the drawboy activated the programmed pattern. However, this wedding sash has ten programmed designs, which required considerable expertise."
