Cleveland Museum of Art API


## Important Links to original dataset information

### The datasets github page https://github.com/ClevelandMuseumArt/openaccess
The main pieces in this github repository are a README markdown file with information, a CSV, and a JSON. The CSV and the JSON are very very large, 59MB and 172MB respectively. You probably don't want to work with these files directly as they would take up a lot of space and be slow to work with.

### The datasets webpage http://openaccess-api.clevelandart.org/
This webpage has general information as well as fields, query parameters, and examples requests to the API. 

## A smaller data subset to work with in CSV format
